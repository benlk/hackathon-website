Official website for the OSU Hackathon

------------

* Sections of our report, presented as individual posts / pages
* A Call for sponsors

wants
-----

I'd prefer it be a static website, clean and nice. We can use any materials
from the [old hackathon website](https://library.osu.edu/find/hackathon) or
also [the twitter](https://twitter.com/@osuhackathon).

# Dev environment

- Ruby 1.9.3: In ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 ruby1.9.1-dev ruby rubygems` (ubuntu weirdness)
- `bundle install` will take care of dependencies
